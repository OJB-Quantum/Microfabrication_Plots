    "Preferential etching of silicon (using EDP, KOH, or TMAH solutions) is a prevalent process step for realizing three-dimensional MEMS structures. Methods for simulating the etching process fall into two categories: Cellular Automata (CA) method and geometric method. In the geometric method, a semiconductor substrate is treated as a continuous entity. In the CA method, on the other hand, a substrate is represented by a large number of cells that reside in a crystalline lattice (e.g. diamond lattice for Si. A material system is described by discrete spatial, temporal, and cell-state variables. During the etching process, the state of each individual cell, i.e. whether it is removed from or remains within the lattice, will be determined by the strength of chemical bounds and link status of its lattice neighbors. The CA method typically requires more computer memory compared with the geometric method; nonetheless, it exhibits high efficiency and accuracy when handling arbitrarily complex mask shapes and merging of three-dimensional structures."

    "Arbitrary etch rates are incorporated using this new non-discrete state designation. During every etch step (with an associated time T), the dimension of a cell will be reduced by an amount that corresponds to the etch rate of the surface on which the cell resides. As an example, if the etch rate of {110} planes is 0.5 (normalized with respect to the fastest etch rate among all major low-index planes), the mass of cells on these surfaces will decrease by 0.5 in each step (with T being 1). If a cell is previously un-etched (i.e. mass equals 1), the value of its mass would be reduced to 0.5 from 1.0 in one etch step; should the etch continue, the mass would subsequently be reduced to 0 during the next step. In this case, one layer of cells on a {110} surface will be removed in two etch steps. The resultant etch rate is 0.5."
